                <h3>Step 3: Find A Protest</h3>

                <p>Once you know which types of protests you are and are not willing to participate in, find out how you can get involved in one. 
                <br><br>
                One example of a website that aims to connect people to protests is <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/">mobilize.us</a>. If you want to find protests local to you that align with your cause, look for activist organizations in your area or a city near you that aligns with your values. You can also get involved in more decentralized protests such as boycotts by searching social media and the news to find out what people are boycotting.
                <br><br>
                It is important that you research any organization or group you choose to align yourself with. See if any protests they have organized in the past have been associated with or even had the goal of violence so that you can stay safe. While a group might share the same values and goals as you, they might not see eye-to-eye on the best way to achieve those goals.
