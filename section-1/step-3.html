                <h3>How, Where, and When Will You Protest?</h3>
                <p>After learning more about what you will be protesting and determining your reason for protesting, you can then figure out the best type of protest for your cause. 
                Some types of protests include: demonstrations, marches, rallies, boycotts, sit-ins, strikes, picketing, petitioning, and civil disobedience. 
                One cause can have multiple avenues of protest that are all pursued at the same time or in sequence. However, this guide is just for beginner individuals, so we will not explore the situation where you are organizing and attending multiple protests. When and where you protest depends on the type of protest you have chosen to do. But there are always laws that need to be followed. Different laws dictate how you can and can’t use public and private property, and this can vary per state. The Supreme Court precedent rules that the government cannot keep you from protesting by they can reasonably dictate the time, place, and manner in which you protest. 

                It is important that you protest somewhere that will reach your target audience for the protest (as much as legally possible). For example if you wanted to protest the government you might picket outside the white house, but you would have to be careful to follow any curfew laws or laws about whether you are on public property as well as be sure you don’t obstruct its use from non-protest-goers. To find your target audience, think about who you would most want to see your protest. Do you want to gain more supporters for the next protest? Gain thousands of signatures for a ballot measure petition or go directly to you source of dissatisfaction and protest outside a business or government building.
