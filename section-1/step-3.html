                <h3>How, Where, and When Will You Protest?</h3>
                <p>After learning more about what you will be protesting and determining your reason for protesting, you can then figure out the best type of protest for your cause. 
                Some types of protests include: demonstrations, marches, rallies, boycotts, sit-ins, strikes, picketing, petitioning, and civil disobedience. 
                One cause can have multiple avenues of protest that are all pursued at the same time or in sequence. However, this guide is just for beginner individuals, so we will not explore the situation where you are organizing and attending multiple protests.
