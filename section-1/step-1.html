                <h3>Who or What Are You Protesting?</h3>
                <p>The first step of protesting is knowing what your protest is going to be all about. Some examples might be protesting a person, organization, government, or corporation.<br>Once you know the subject of the protest, it is important to find out more about them. Some questions you might ask yourself are:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>What specifically am I protesting?</li>
                    <li>Was it an event, action, new practice, or long-standing practice of this subject?</li> 
                    <li>Do I have reliable sources telling me more about it?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Some might think they want to protest something after hearing a sensationalized bit of information or seeing a clickbait headline. But in order to actually begin to protest, you need to be sure you know what/who exactly you are protesting to make sure you stand behind the message of the protest.
