                <h3>Who or What Are You Protesting?</h3>

                <p>The first step of protesting is knowing what your protest is going to be all about. Some examples might be protesting a person, organization, government, or corporation.</p>

                <p>Once you know the subject of the protest, it is important to find out more about them. Some questions you might ask yourself are: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What specifically am I protesting?</li>
                    <li>Was it an event, action, new practice, or long-standing practice of this subject?</li>
                    <li>Do I have reliable sources telling me more about it?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some might think they want to protest something after hearing a sensationalized bit of information or seeing a clickbait headline. But in order to actually begin to protest, you need to be sure you know what/who exactly you are protesting to make sure you stand behind the message of the protest.
                </p>

                <p>After you establish the general idea of what you are protesting, do some research to find out more about it. Research gives you clearly defined pieces of evidence about what you are protesting. </p>

                <p><b>Examples of Bad Who/What:</b></p>
                    <ul class="bad-list">
                        <li><i>"I am protesting the government"</i>
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> Be more specific. What part of the government? What practice, action, or person/group in the government?</li>
                        <li><i>"I am protesting overspending"</i>
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> Whose overspending are you protesting? The federal government? The local government? Your own? This can be a good "what" but you need to establish who is doing it.</li>
                        <li><i>"I am protesting [company]"</i>
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> Similar to the first one, this is to broad. What are you protesting about them? There are many things companies does that you might want to protest. Just typing in "[company name]" in a search engine will get you their website, not any research about what you want to protest.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><b>Examples of Good Who/What:</b></p>
                    <ul class="good-list">
                        <li><i>" I am protesting the government's treatment of [group]"</i>
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> Throughout history there have been many protests based off how the government treats a specific group or country. And researching their treatment of a specific group gives you a specific protest</li>
                        <li><i>"I am protesting the federal government's overspending"</i>
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> Lots of people dislike how much the government spends, as it can lead to higher taxes or wastefulness of taxes. This is a more specific grievance with the government than just protesting the government in general.</li>
                        <li><i>"I am protesting [company]'s values"</i>
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> Depending on the why and how, this can be a good protest. Some companies have values that mean they will mistreat their employees or sell low quality products just for profit.</li>
                    </ul>
