                <p>You might already have an idea in mind of what you want to protest, whether it be something specific or just the general feeling of wanting to change something. Either way, before continuing, here are some questions to ask yourself:

                -Who or what am I protesting?
                -Why am I protesting?
                -How much do I know about this cause?

                If you are unclear on any of these things, you likely need to do more research. It is important that before you begin to protest, you first know as much as possible about what you are protesting and why you are protesting it in the first place. Without a clear picture on these things, you might spread misinformation, accidentally end up fighting against your morals, or pursue ineffective avenues of protest. 

                To get started investigating your cause, look for reliable new articles, scholarly articles, statistics/data, and other sources of information that will give you hard facts and evidence to inform your opinion.

                Once you have learned more about the proven facts, you might look into testimonies and stories related to your cause. The combinations of testimonies and data will aid you in convincing others of your cause and informing yourself exactly where you stand on this issue.
