                <h3>Why Are You Protesting?</h3>
                <p>After finding out what/who you are protesting, you next want to establish why you want to protest this. Do their actions or practices affect (or threaten to affect) you, people you know, or other people in general? Is it because something they did is against your morals? You need to establish what it was that happened that was so bad you feel the need to try to stop it.

                Without a reason behind your protest, you might lose motivation or not have the passion for your cause. Without motivation or passion, your efforts are half-hearted and if you wish to inspire or convince others to fight for your cause it will be near impossible.
