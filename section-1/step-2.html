                <h3>Why Are You Protesting?</h3>

                <p>After finding out what/who you are protesting, you next want to establish why you want to protest this. Do their actions or practices affect (or threaten to affect) you, people you know, or other people in general? Is it because something they did is against your morals? <b>You need to establish your motivation in order to stay focused and to turn your feelings into actions.</b></p>

                <p>Without a strong motivation behind your protest, your efforts will be half-hearted and weak. If you wish to inspire others it will be hard, and if you wish to make a change it likely won't happen. 
                </p>

                <p><b>Examples of Bad Motivations:</b></p>
                    <ul class="bad-list">
                        <li>Wanting to gain attention on social media<br>Reason: If you don't get attention or if you get more negative attention than positive you will abandon the cause</li>
                        <li>You had a bad experience being served at a company so you don't want anyone to buy from them again<br>Reason: One bad personal is not enough for others to join your cause</li>
                        <li>There is a personal characteristic you don't like about a politician so you want to get them out of office<br>Reason: Something personal about a politician such as their race, gender, religion, etc. is not indicative of whether or not they can do their job well</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><b>Examples of Good Motivations:</b></p>
                    <ul class="good-list">
                        <li>Wanting to bring awareness to something you find important
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> If you find it important enough then even gaining awareness from one person will give you the motivation to keep going until as many people as possible know about it</li>
                        <li>The values of the company are discriminatory so you don't want to buy anything from them again
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> Many people do not like discrimination, and boycotting that company will keep you and others from funding those values</li>
                        <li>A politician votes for bills that cause negative effects on your community so you want to vote them out of office
                        <br><b>Reason:</b> If a politician is causing negative effects on their constituent it is important to bring awareness and get people to vote in someone else in the next election</li>
