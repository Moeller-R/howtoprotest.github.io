            <div id="content">
                <p>Under the first amendment we are given the right to freedom of speech. Speech not only encompasses spoken words, but different forms of expression and communication as well. However, like with many other rights, this is not a pass to just do or say anything you want, the Supreme Court has interpreted this portion of the constitution as allowing for some restriction. 

                Some forms of speech are virtually unrestrictable, and this is called protected speech. And the types of speech that can be regulated are called unprotected speech. 

                So what speech is protected or unprotected? Since most speech is protected, it easier to list the kinds that aren't.

                Unprotected Speech:

                Obscenity -
                To determine if content counts as obscenity, the court applies the Miller Test by evaluating:
                (1) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;
                (2) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and
                (3) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

                Defamation -
                This includes both slander and libel. Slander being spoken, and libel being written, both are false statements that cause damage to someone's reputation. In addition to limiting freedom of speech this limits freedom of the press, as many cases establishing precedent for this were due to news media cases. If someone says or publishes something false about someone and harms their reputation, this is not protected speech. The one initiating the case (the plaintiff) must prove that the statements are false and that they damaged their reputation in order to receive remediation. In the case of a public figure, the public figure must also prove the slander or libel was made with the knowledge it was false or that there was a blatant disregard for whether it was false or not.

                Fraud - 
                This is another form of untrue speech that is not protected. Simply lying can be protected speech, but if the speech then causes damages to someone by the speaker knowingly misrepresenting facts it is fraud and this is unprotected speech. 




                Incitement - 
                If the speech promotes or calls people to commit crimes and is likely to succeed in the call to action soon after it is not protected. If someone simply advocates for crime but the government can’t prove that this advocacy will cause someone to commit crime soon after seeing the advocacy the speech is still protected.

                Fighting Words -
                Like incitement, fighting words can cause violence or are words intended to provoke someone. Like in the name, fighting words can cause a fight. Due to the possibility or intent to cause violence, this is not protected speech. However, not just any offensive words are fighting words, and it needs to be said face-to-face with the likelihood of causing immediate violence.

                True Threats -
                If something someone says can be construed as a serious threat with intent to follow through that involves violence or other crimes it can count as a true threat. The government can restrict this speech, a possible charge might be something along the lines of “intent to …”. Though not just any threatening sounding speech can be regulated, it needs to sound (to a reasonable person) like a serious and credible threat. And even if the person later claims the threat to not be real, the government might still be able prosecute a person based on the fact that their speech can be construed as a threat.  

                Speech Integral To Criminal Conduct - 
                If the speech is used in order to commit a crime or with the intent to commit a crime it can be criminalized. This allows some buffer for some crimes to be stopped before they happen with “intent to” and “conspiracy to” charges. Even if someone hasn’t committed the crime yet, if there is substantial evidence they are planning to commit the crime based on their speech they can be prosecuted for the speech. Without this exception, police wouldn’t be able to stop crimes they know are going to happen just based on the criminal’s speech. 

                Child Pornography -
                This is an example of where a content-based restriction can be valid, as preventing harm and abuse of children is a legitimate and important government interest. Unlike other forms of speech that people might want to restrict due to them not personally liking it, child pornography is not merely offensive but has a material harm and is inherently a crime and therefore is not protected speech.
