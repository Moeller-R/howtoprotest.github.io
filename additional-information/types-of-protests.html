                <h3>Types Of Protests</h3>

                <ul class="undecorated-list">
                    <li><h3>Strike</h3>
                        <i>description:</i> When workers collectively agree to stop working at their place of employment. This is usually done due to unhappiness with a work condition, compensation, or whenever else their employer is not treating them to the workers standard. If all other avenues of trying to improve a grievance are exhausted, the workers will then stop working.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <i>purpose:</i> The stoppage of work shows the employer how their business is affected without any workers. If there are no workers there is no business going to happen. In theory this would make the employer realize how important the workers are and this would cause the employer to try to meet the demands in order to keep the workers and get them to work again. 
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Demonstration/Rally/March</h3>
                        <i>description:</i> A large gathering of people typically with speeches, signs, and chants. Signs are used to communicate the cause being protested for. Speeches are done to inspire people or as another form of communicating the reason for the protest. 
                        <br><br>
                        In a march the group of people is mobile and might be going to a specific location related to their cause, otherwise they might just be trying to cover a large area in order to give their message more reach. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        <i>purpose:</i> To bring awareness to or show support for a cause. A large group of people bring media attention which can put the issue in front of new people who didnâ€™t know about it. It can also show leaders the amount of support for an issue. Some officials might see this and try to cater towards this cause for votes in a future election. 
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Petition</h3>
                        <i>description:</i> This is not always thought of as a form of protest, but it can be. Some states allow for ballot issues to be proposed by citizens, and if petitions reach enough signatures it can reach the ballot. 
                        <br><br>
                        Petitions can also be more symbolic, as a means to show support for or against something. This is commonly seen on change.org, where people will create petitions for a cause. These petitions are not binding, but public pressure and opinion can solve some less controversial issues. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        <i>purpose:</i> Petition purposes can range from a symbolic show of support or opposition. But more official ones can aim to actually directly affect laws through voting.
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Boycott</h3>
                        <i>description:</i> This can be an individual or group protest, though is more effective as a group. The participants of a boycott will agree to stop engaging with or buying products from a company or entity. 
                        <br><br>
                        Typically boycotts are done against companies, but it can be done against others such as government officials or parties. This can be done by refusing to vote for a specific candidate in protest to their previous actions or perhaps in protest to your political party nominating this candidate. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        <i>purpose:</i> When agreeing to not buy product from the target of the protest the goal can be to show dissatisfaction with product quality, price, or can be based on principle. The purpose would be to make the company realize they need to change something if they either want to gain customers back and/or keep from losing other customers. 
                        <br><br>
                        In some instances a company with stronger public relations might cave to social pressure, but in other instances it might take them losing money to actually make a change. In a smaller boycott the social pressure might be stronger, and in a large boycott companies will risk lots of profit by not changing. 
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Civil Disobedience</h3>
                        <i>description:</i> Typically this type of protest can be controversial as it involves breaking laws. People who engage in civil disobedience will refuse to follow a law they find unjust. A key element is that this is a form of peaceful protest and that the laws are broken in a public way.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <i>purpose:</i> Whichever law is being broken is one the protesters disagree with. Hence, they aim to change the law or to at least highlight to others why this law is unjust. 
                        <br><br>
                        Especially in more egregious cases of unjust laws, if the government chooses to enforce the law on those who engage in this protest, they risk exposing to others the unjustness of the law. However, if they choose not to enforce the law it risks showing people that the government officials might not agree with the law either.
