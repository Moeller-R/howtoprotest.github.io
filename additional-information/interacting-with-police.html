                <h3>Interacting With Police</h3>

                <p>Even if you do follow the law 100% of the time, there are still instances where police might see you as suspicious or think you might have broken a law. There are also times where you might not even know if you have broken a law or not. And in even more unfortunate cases, even though the police are there to enforce laws, they don’t always follow the laws themselves. 
                <br><br>
                So what do you do if you are stopped by police at a protest? 
                <br><br>
                The first thing you’ll want to do before even going to a protest is to research the local laws on protests, and as mentioned before, make sure the protest you are going to is permit compliant if required. Aside from permits, there are also other laws that might vary by state or municipality, such as locations you are allowed to protest, how many people are allowed to be there, etc. And these restrictions can vary based on the time of day due to quiet hours/curfews. Making sure you are informed on the local laws will help ensure that you know you didn’t break any laws accidentally and you can feel more confident if confronted by police. 
                <br><br>
                In an instance where you are stopped by authorities, first, stay calm and don’t act confrontational. Ask if you are free to leave and if told yes then walk away calmly. However, if you are not free to go, remain there until you are given the all clear to go. You have the right to ask why you are being detained, as the officer cannot detain you for just any reason, they need a reasonable suspicion that you could have committed a crime. 
                <br><br>
                You do not have to answer any questions, except in some states where you are required to identify yourself. It is recommended that you verbally state you are invoking your right to silence under the 5th amendment. You do not have to allow them to search your belongings, but in some instances they can do it regardless. They cannot demand you to show them photographs or videos you have taken without a warrant. Above all, do not become physical or argumentative. You can be cooperative by doing all the things required of you in a calm manner, but even if you are innocent, answering questions or talking to police is not recommended. 
                <br><br>
                If you are merely detained, yet not under arrest, you can make a phone call to a lawyer if you have one. If it escalates to you being under arrest and you don’t have a lawyer, you can then request a lawyer be appointed to you. Do not answer any questions or sign anything without talking to the lawyer first, as it will not help you in court even if you are innocent.
