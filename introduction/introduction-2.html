                <h3>What Is The Goal Of A Protest?</h3>

                <p>The goal of a protest can typically be classified into 1 of 2 categories: <b>concrete outcome</b> or <b>communicative outcome</b>. This guide will largely be referring to protests with a communicative goal/outcome.
                <br><br>
                A concrete outcome is one in which a change is actually made as a result of the protest, and a communicative outcome is when the message of the protest reaches more people. Concrete protests can be the result of many communicative protests, and communicative protests can have the goal of one day leading to a concrete protest.
                <br><br>
                The goal of a protest is not necessarily what the outcome will be, as it depends on the actions and strategy during the protest. Many people go into a communicative protest, thinking that it will lead to a concrete outcome, only to be disappointed and believing the protest to only be “performative”. This can be due to naivety or misinformation, but regardless, a concrete goal cannot happen without concrete action.
