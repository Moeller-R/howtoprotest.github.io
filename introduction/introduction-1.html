                <p>Before you begin to protest, first you need to know what a protest is in the first place. In this instance it is defined as “a complaint, objection, or display of unwillingness usually to an idea or a course of action.” (merriam webster dictionary)

                Typically when hearing about protests in the media, you might think of a demonstration, rally, or march. But there are many types of protests, which all combine these aspects of objecting and displaying your distaste towards something. Each one of them has their own purpose and use-case. 

                While protest can be done individually, an effective protest is usually a cooperative, group activity. The purpose is to join with others to achieve a goal or spread a message, likely so that eventually there won’t be the need for that protest anymore.
