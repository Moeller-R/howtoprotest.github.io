                <h3>What Are Your Rights?</h3>

                <p>The biggest source of your right to protest comes from the first amendment that allows you free speech, freedom of the press, right of the people to peacefully assemble, and to “petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” However, these freedoms are not completely unlimited. The supreme court has determined the government cannot keep you from protesting but they can add restricts on the time, place, and manner as long at the restriction is not biased against what the protest is about, it must have a good reason for it, and they must offer or leave other opportunities for the protest to still happen in some way. 

                For more specificities, review these supreme court cases to see what the supreme court has interpreted the first amendment and constitution as allowing.

                Some important takeaways are that you cannot incite insurrection, violence, or illegal activities. Hate speech is protected as long as it doesn’t incite violence or illegal activities. People are allowed to burn the flag as long as it isn’t accompanied by a call to overthrow the government. Students cannot be forced to stand for the pledge. Students do not lose their first amendment rights when they enter school.
