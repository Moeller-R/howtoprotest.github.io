                <h3>Step 2: Prepare Supplies</h3>
            
                <p>After becoming informed of your rights, the next thing to prepare is supplies you will need. </p>

                <ul class="undecorated-list">
                    <li><h3>Signs</h3>
                        <p>
                            Check with the event organizers and see if signs will be provided. If yes, then you don’t have to make one. If not, then ask them what types of messages they want on the signs. Having specific messaging on signs is a feature of some protests to create a more cohesive message. Making more than one can be helpful if you lose or break one or if you want to share with others who weren’t able to bring any.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><h3>Snacks and Drinks</h3>
                        <p>
                            Protests can last for hours and larger ones can be hard to move around in if you suddenly feel thirsty or hungry. In marches you will be walking most of the time and won’t have time to stop for these things. Bring plenty of food and water so that you aren’t feeling faint and hungry the whole time. If it is a hot day bring extra water for yourself and potential others, as when the weather warms up having water is not a matter of comfort but of safety.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>First-Aid Kit and Safety Gear</h3>
                        <p>
                            Similarly with food and water, you can’t just drop everything and make your way to get supplies. Any sorts of trips, scrapes, and bruises can happen. In larger protests there is also the risk of trampling if people aren’t careful. And if worst comes to worst, there can be violence that leads to tear gas and rubber bullets. This is why it’s also a good idea to bring goggles and a mask. Especially in a more controversial protest, there can be counter protesters who agitate others or opportunists who join the crowd as a means to cover their crimes.

                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Weather Based Supplies</h3>
                        <p>
                            Check on the weather forecast and see what things you might need for that specific weather. Examples include an umbrella, sunscreen, or an extra jacket. Sunscreen is recommended for all sorts of weather, especially if you will be outside for a long time. You should also make sure to dress for the weather so you aren't shivering the whole time or sweating after only 20 minutes.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li><h3>Personal items</h3>
                        <p>
                            Things such as your phone, a charging bank, and your wallet (ID and cash included) can help in cases of emergency that you didn’t anticipate. You can also bring earplugs to protect your ears in a large protest, as there will probably be lots of yelling and music. Make sure to keep your wallet close, as mentioned before, there might be opportunist criminals looking to pickpocket people in a large crowd. Also don’t forget any personal medicine or other supplies you cannot go without. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                </ul>   

                <p>
                Some of these supplies might not be needed in many cases, but remember to always be prepared. The bigger and/or more controversial a protest is, the more risk there is of violence. If possible, bring someone with you or contact someone so they know where you are. Even if some of it might be silly, your safety is a higher priority than anything else.
