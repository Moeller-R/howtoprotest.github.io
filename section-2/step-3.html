                <h3>Step 3: Prepare For The Worst-Case Scenario</h3>

                <p>In addition to preparing supplies, you also need to prepare knowledge. Learn the layout of the location where you will be. If it is a march, learn the route and find a good place to park or get dropped off. Prepare an emergency route in your head of how to get back to your car or out of there in case something happens. 
                <br><br>
                Don’t take risks, if you have a low battery on your phone and don’t have any charge left in your power bank, don’t risk it and just go home. 
                <br><br>
                Be aware of counter protestors and do not engage with them. If anything seems off or like something bad is going to happen, get out of there as soon as possible. While some people might be willing to sacrifice their safety for a cause, it is not a smart idea to do that at your first protest. Get more experience and then you can make an informed decision about how far you are willing to go. Stay safe. 
                <br><br>
                Now that you are prepared with your supplies and knowledge, it’s time to show up. See if you can touch base with the organizers or someone in a leadership position to see if you need to know anything specific. Let them know it is your first protest and ask if they have any personal tips.
