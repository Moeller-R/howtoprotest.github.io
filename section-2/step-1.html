                <h3>How to Find A Protest</h3>

                <p>Large scale national protests will be easier to find since they are more widely talked about and spread around. Check social media and forums such as reddit, X, and different apps designed for it. You might find ones that you have to travel for or get lucky and find local ones on these sources.

                One app/website commonly suggested online to look for protests is Mobilize. It includes features that allow you to filter by topic and you can even see the accessibility of the protest if you are mobility impaired. It also includes other activist activities besides in-person protests such as volunteer opportunities to send out things encouraging people to vote.

                Typically to find smaller, local protests you will have to have in person connections with people who attend or organize these protests. Local facebook pages might be an online option, but otherwise you can join local organizations that align with your values and views.
