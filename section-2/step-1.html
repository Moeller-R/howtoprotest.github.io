                <h3>Step 1: Know Your Rights</h3>

                <p>Now that you have found a protest to participate in. It is time to actually participate in or attend the protest. For some protests it is as simple as not buying from a company and letting them know what it will take to get you back as a customer (boycott). For others, such as in person demonstrations, rallies, marches, etc. there are some extra cautionary steps you need to take and things you need to prepare.
                <br><br>
                One of the number 1 most important things is knowing your rights. You need to know exactly what you can and can’t do legally and what to do in the event you encounter law enforcement.
                <br><br>
                In the United States we are given the right to protest under the first amendment. The word “protest” is not explicitly mentioned as a right, but many of the actions associated with protesting are (speech, assembly, and petition), and as a result the courts hold protesting to be a right.
                <br><br>
                However, like any right, these rights are not unlimited, and can still be restricted in some way. An established doctrine for the restriction of protesting is the Time, Place, and Manner doctrine. Under this doctrine a law cannot outlaw protest but it can limit <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, and <i>how</i> the protest takes place. This is so long as the law is content neutral (they cannot ban a protest topic), it still provides or leaves a way for the protest to happen (you might need a permit), and it advances a specific purpose such as safety or peace (the law cannot be just because).
                <br><br>
                The Supreme Court has also ruled that not even freedom of speech is unlimited, and <a href="../additional-information/protected-vs-unprotected-speech.html">some forms of speech are considered “unprotected”</a> meaning they can be limited under laws. Make sure to research the local laws and <a href="../additional-information/supreme-court-cases.html">court cases</a> to see if any of the activities or speech you will be engaging in is limited.
                <br><br>
                So, you can protest, but there might be some additional laws you need to follow for the sake of peace and safety. Make sure that whatever protest you attend has the required permits and that you follow the terms of the permit if you want to stay in accordance with the law.
