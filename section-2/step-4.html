                <h3>What Should You Do The Worst Case Scenario?</h3>

                <p>Not every peaceful protest ends peacefully. Especially when the protesters are addressing something more controversial, agitators might join the group to stir tensions to make the group look bad. There might also exist opportunists who aren’t on either side but just want to use the protest as a cover for their looting. Other times people who initially started peaceful might get angry or especially passionate. Either way, despite your best intentions and the intentions of the protest organizers, peaceful protests can go south and in those instances it’s important to be prepared. 

                Make sure you know how to get out of there if you need to. 

                Before going contact someone to let them know what you are up to and where you are going so they know to check up on you. 

                Record badges numbers of police officers who seem like they want to stir things up or are using unnecessary force. 

                Comply with police officers and don’t say anything without a lawyer even if you didn’t commit any crimes. 

                If stopped by police follow these steps:
                    Ask if you are free to leave.
                    If they say yes then just calmly walk away and get out of the area.
                    If they say no, ask if you are being arrested. And if they say yes then take note of if they read you your rights. 
                    Tell them you are requesting a lawyer and are invoking your right to stay silent. After this, use your right to stay silent and don’t say anything until you get a lawyer, whether or not you did something wrong.
