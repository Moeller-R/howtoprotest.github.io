                <h3>What To Do When You Show Up</h3>

                <p>In a bigger protest you can sometimes just follow the crowds and figure out what to do from people around you. There might be cheers and chants you can join in and signs passed around if you didnâ€™t bring your own.

                In smaller, more organized protests you might want to find the organizers and touch base with them to find out where you are needed/wanted. 

                In some protests the goal is to get as many people there as possible to visually show the amount of support for the cause, but in other protests there are more organized roles and things to say as the goal in those instances is to get out a specific message. But in either instance as long as both you and the other protesters have the same understanding of being peaceful and working towards the same cause it will go fine.
